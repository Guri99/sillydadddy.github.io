# AMA with [Adam Nyagte](https://twitter.com/adam_nygate) & [Jamie Slome](https://twitter.com/JamieSlome)

<br>

## [Adam Nyagte](https://twitter.com/adam_nygate) & [Jamie Slome](https://twitter.com/JamieSlome) are the founder and co-founder of the [Huntr](https://www.huntr.dev/) Bug Bounty platform :fire:

<br>

 - What, why and how of [@huntrdev](https://www.huntr.dev/)? Any interesting plans for 2021?

   - ***What: we pay hackers to find and fix vulnerabilities in open source code.***

   - ***Why: because currently, it takes over 4.5 years for the average vulnerability to be found and fixed.***

   - ***How: we've raised some cash from VC's and pay this out to the bug bounty hunters.***

   - ***Plans: coming soon...***

<br>

 - I just wanna ask you I almost hit 11 months in bug bounty hunting field without finding any valid bug, I just wanna ask you how to stick hunting on single program I can't do it idk why I didn't find a program I am comfortable with!? Any advices?
 
   - ***Surround yourself with previously disclosed and fixed vulnerabilities in a language you are familiar with. Try building a network of security researchers, or developers who have had prior success. Our Discord may be a good place to start - <http://huntr.dev/discord>.***

<br>

 - What are the methods you guys perform in bugbounty JS? Any hints for noobs who deal with bugbounty JS file?

   - ***It can be difficult to get started with bug bounty! If you are familiar with JavaScript, you could always take a look at our JS bounties in open source packages - <https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/>.***

<br>

 - Any weird bug you reported which you are proud of?

   - ***Although we didn't report it, we found the recent Lodash prototype pollution to be pretty interesting. Read about it here: <https://huntr.dev/blog/lodash-understanding-the-vulnerability-and-how-we-can-rally-behind-packages>.***

<br>

 - Is it worth it to make an open source software? I mean.. if it's free.. how can you make a living off of it?

   - ***Absolutely worth it! You can always leverage the software you have written to secure a job or even start a new career in a code related industry. Businesses and hobbyists that use your software may also drop you some Banknote with dollar sign every so often.***
