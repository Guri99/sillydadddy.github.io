 - What are your most discovered vulnerabilities? What vulnerabilities are you professionally looking for?

   - ***Broken Access Control.***

<br>

 - Tell us about your setup for bug hunting i.e. toolings, checklist, VPS, note-keeping etc? What will be the scenario of bug bounty in 2021 according to your opinion? There are uncountable resources, so how can I know that which resource is best for me to get started?

   - ***Honestly nothing fancy, Burp, Notepad++ to take notes, I follow my own methodology checklist and some burp extensions!***

   - ***More money and more opportunity my friend!***

   - ***Listen to interviews from people who have been successful and apply that knowledge to yourself.***

<br>

 - Q1) How much time you give to bug hunting? 

 - Q2) How much time to recon when you start on program? 

 - Q3) Android app hunting?

   1. ***50-60 hours a week.***

   2. ***When I start a brand new web app, I will spend about 2-3 days doing recon and getting to know the app better.***

   3. ***SPARINGLY but yes I've got a few Android vulns under my belt!***

<br>

 - How do you approach JS analysis in your methodology?

   - ***Searching for params, different keywords like Key, Token, redirect, url or any words that are relevant to the app you are testing.***

<br>

 - What's your hacking schedule?

   - ***So Mon-Fri is about 8-10 hours and sat-sun is about 4-6 hours.***

<br>

 - How many breaks do you take during hunting? How long are they? Do you use a timer? What do you do on these breaks?

   - ***So I've been toying with Pomodoro when doing the recon phase of starting a new app. It definitely helps in absorbing all the information. However when Im just hacking and looking for vulns ill typically do about 6 hours in the morning, 2-3 hour break and then 2-3 hours of hacking.***

   - ***During my breaks, Ill typically eat, game sleep, maybe go kick it with a friend! whatever I want haha.***

<br>

 - How do you learn new bugs and how do you explore new things in web applications hacking?

   - ***Pick vulnerabilities -> Exercise on labs -> Read some writeups -> Hunt on a program.***

<br>

 - You learn hacking from books or video tutorials?

   - ***Writeups/Labs/Videos. I actually just ordered my first book related to hacking yesterday.***

<br>

 - Any suggestions on business logic vulnerabilities?

   - ***Spend time getting to know the app and take lots of notes!! Business logic vulns are unique to the web app itself.***

<br>

 - I am learning about Graphql right now on a hacking perspective. Should I only focus on important things like interception query or is there a better way to do it?

   - ***Ill be honest with you, Im horrendous with GraphQL lol, However [@InsiderPhD](https://twitter.com/InsiderPhD) and [@Farah_Hawaa](https://twitter.com/Farah_Hawaa) have some really great videos on GraphQL that you should check out! Head to <http://Pentester.land> after and search for GraphQL writeups. [@PentesterLab](https://twitter.com/PentesterLab) has an awesome couple of labs.***

<br>

 - What activities make you better at bug hunting? What resources you think to be good except write-ups? What keeps you motivated?

   - ***I can answer all that with the same answer. I really do enjoy doing labs and ctf. You learn alot, its also a playground to practice and play around with different vulnerabilities that you otherwise probably would never get a chance to out in the wild [@PentesterLab](https://twitter.com/PentesterLab) & [@WebSecAcademy](https://twitter.com/WebSecAcademy).***

<br>

 - What are some signs that you look for to determine whether a bug bounty program is worth going after or not?

   - ***To me I enjoy an app with alot of features, more features mean more attack surface, more API calls, more code which translates to more mistakes.***

<br>

 - What was the lamest bug, that made you a decent sized bounty?

   - ***There was one where I found an IP address belonging to them, went to visit it, downloaded some weird certificate, so I reported it and made $1000. Super weird.***
