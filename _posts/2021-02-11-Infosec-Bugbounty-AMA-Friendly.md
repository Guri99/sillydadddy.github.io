<br>

 - What was your first bug? Since when are you in Infosec? Best thing bought with bounties?

   - ***0day for IPB. (Invision Powerboard) Obviously reported and patched.***

   - ***Got into infosec around 2015-ish. That’s around when I discovered bug bounty. I had my own gaming forum back in 2010 - mainly game hacking. So I had an advantage in “web hacking”.***

   - ***Learning new attacks!***

<br>

 - What advice would you give your 16 yr old self?

   - ***I would tell him “focus on school rather than this nonsense.” That 16 yr old me would understand it and listen. (The reason behind this is - my grades were tad bad, but improved as time went on).***

   - ***I would personally tell him to read what he’s doing rather than messing with random payloads and hope it pops/works. Also, tell him understand the sites functions, how it outputs the code. Mainly reading and understanding to sum it up.***

<br>

 - Being a doctor, how you got interested in hacking? What is your bug hunting methodology?

   - ***Being a doctor and bug hunter is fun. I got interested in bug hunting years ago though - say around 2015-ish. I was really terrible at the start. Improved as time goes.***

   - ***My methods are no secret - It’s all about asking questions. Shadow answers all my questions and helps me.***

<br>

 - Do you recommend collaboration for beginners or not?

   - ***Personally I would not recommend it. People tend to like to work with others who are above their “level” or “on their level.” As mean as that sounds, it’s somewhat true. However, asking questions when you’re in need of help is not bad. So ask!***

<br>

 - How to get a remote job in Cybersecurity?

   - ***Landing a remote job in cyber security shouldn’t too be hard. Have some sort of technical background, programming background, a degree in C.S, some A+ bug hunting skills and something more.... - Oh, looking for jobs that hires for cyber security.***

<br>

 - How to get good at hacking?

   - ***To “get good”, you must first be good. Kidding. Applying yourself by studying, reading and asking questions can help you become a great bug hunter. Sometimes it may not click the first few times - but you will get it and understand. (Eg today).***
